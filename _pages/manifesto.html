  <p>
    Welcome to the world of research, where no one fully knows what they’re doing, and that’s exactly the point.
    To help you navigate this beautiful chaos, here is a lighthearted manifesto built from years of advising,
    supervising, and watching ideas grow.
  </p>

  <p>
    Take it with humor. Take it seriously too. Both are allowed.
  </p>

  <ol class="principles">
    <li>
      <h3>Default to “Why not?” instead of “Why no?”</h3>
      <p>
        Every research direction begins as a tiny spark. Before you pour water on it, try adding oxygen.
      </p>
      <p class="contrast">
        <strong>Instead of:</strong> “I’m not sure this makes sense…”<br />
        <strong>Try:</strong> “Let me explore how this could make sense.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Great researchers don’t start by rejecting ideas. They start by playing with them.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Initiative is your superpower</h3>
      <p>
        A PhD is not a scavenger hunt where the advisor gives clues. It’s your own expedition.
      </p>
      <p>When you hear a suggestion, ask yourself:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What can I try immediately?</li>
        <li>What alternatives can I propose?</li>
        <li>What prior work can I consult to support or refute this direction?</li>
        <li>What experiment can I design without waiting for permission?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If your advisor gives you a seed, grow a forest — don’t hand the seed back and ask how to plant it.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Think beyond the details: master abstraction</h3>
      <p>
        Research often requires stepping back and seeing patterns: what is the underlying idea, what is really
        being compared, and what metric captures the phenomenon.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you find yourself stuck, zoom out. If zooming out doesn’t help, zoom out again.
        Abstraction is not optional, but it’s the fuel of clarity.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Replace fear of being wrong with curiosity</h3>
      <p>
        You are not expected to know everything. You are expected to explore boldly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being wrong is not a failure. It’s the fee you pay for discovering something right.
      </p>
      <p class="contrast">
        Your advisor would much rather see:<br />
        <strong>“Here is an idea I tried. It didn’t work, but here’s why.”</strong><br />
        than:<br />
        <strong>“I wasn’t sure, so I didn’t try.”</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Curiosity beats perfection, every time.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Progress comes from motion, not permission</h3>
      <p>
        Real research rarely comes as a precise recipe. It emerges from tinkering, testing, trying, tweaking,
        breaking things, and fixing them.
      </p>
      <p>
        If every suggestion becomes a question, you lose momentum. If every suggestion becomes an experiment,
        you gain a thesis.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Build research muscle: own the project</h3>
      <p>
        A PhD is training for independent researcher mode. That means proposing directions, defending choices,
        justifying assumptions, and bringing ideas your advisor didn’t think about.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your advisor’s job is not to think alone. It’s to think with you and eventually, to watch you think
        beyond them.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Take the work seriously, not yourself</h3>
      <p>
        Laugh at failed experiments. Celebrate small wins. Share imperfect ideas early.
        Serious research does not require a serious face.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

    <h3>Final Word</h3>
    <p>
      If you explore instead of avoid, propose instead of wait, abstract instead of freeze, experiment instead
      of hesitate, and stay curious instead of cautious, you’ll do great.
    </p>
