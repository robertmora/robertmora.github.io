**ðŸš§ Note: This website is currently under construction as Iâ€™ve just started building it. Some sections may be incomplete or updated frequently â€” thanks for your patience!**

Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor in the Communication Systems Department at [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr/en){:target="_blank"}, a [*Grande Ã‰cole*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_%C3%A9cole){:target="_blank"}, research center, and graduate school located in the beautiful [*French Riviera (CÃ´te d'Azur)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Riviera){:target="_blank"}. Iâ€™m also a [Docent](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/about-us/people/researchers-and-teachers/docents){:target="_blank"} at the University of Helsinki, Finland. Before joining EURECOM, I was a Senior Researcher in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki. Earlier in my career (2014â€“2022), I spent eight years at Ericsson Research Finland, first with the Cloud and System Platforms team and later with the IoT Technologies & Cyber-Physical Systems team.

I earned my PhD in Networking Technology from Aalto University (Finland) in 2019, where I was supervised by Prof. [JÃ¶rg Ott](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/ott-joerg){:target="_blank"} and was also a Marie SkÅ‚odowska-Curie research fellow in the FP7 ITN project METRICS (2014â€“2018). From 2019 to 2021, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the EDGE Lab, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Princeton University (USA), under the supervision of Prof. [Mung Chiang](https://www.purdue.edu/president/about/mung-chiang/){:target="_blank"}. Over the years, I have also held visiting research positions at INRIA Lille (France), the Technical University of Munich (Germany), Aalto University (Finland), and Yale University (USA).

My research lies at the intersection of Networked Systems, Edge Computing, and Distributed AI, focusing on trade-offs in AI service provisioning, interoperability, and lifecycle management under computing- and networking-resource constraints.

Some time ago, I shared more about my background and career path in an interview on the EURECOM Medium blog â€” you can read it [here](https://eurecom-blog.medium.com/meet-our-faculty-roberto-morabito-assistant-professor-in-the-communication-systems-department-at-7af141c2cfa2){:target="_blank"}.
