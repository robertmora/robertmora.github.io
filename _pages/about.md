**ðŸš§ Note: This website is currently under construction as Iâ€™ve just started building it. Some sections may be incomplete or updated frequently â€” thanks for your patience!**

Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor in the Communication Systems Department at [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr/en), a [*Grande Ã‰cole*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_%C3%A9cole), research center, and graduate school located in the beautiful [*French Riviera (CÃ´te d'Azur)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Riviera). Iâ€™m also a [Docent](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/about-us/people/researchers-and-teachers/docents) at the University of Helsinki, Finland. Before joining EURECOM, I was a Senior Researcher in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki. Earlier in my career (2014â€“2022), I spent eight years at Ericsson Research Finland, first with the Cloud and System Platforms team and later with the IoT Technologies & Cyber-Physical Systems team.

I earned my PhD in Networking Technology from Aalto University (Finland) in 2019, where I was supervised by Prof. [JÃ¶rg Ott](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/ott-joerg) and was also a Marie SkÅ‚odowska-Curie research fellow in the FP7 ITN project METRICS (2014â€“2018). From 2019 to 2021, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the EDGE Lab, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Princeton University (USA), under the supervision of Prof. [Mung Chiang](https://www.purdue.edu/president/about/mung-chiang/).

My research lies at the intersection of Networked Systems, Edge Computing, and Distributed AI, focusing on trade-offs in AI service provisioning, interoperability, and lifecycle management under computing- and networking-resource constraints.

Some time ago, I shared more about my background and career path in an interview on the EURECOM Medium blog â€” you can read it [here](https://eurecom-blog.medium.com/meet-our-faculty-roberto-morabito-assistant-professor-in-the-communication-systems-department-at-7af141c2cfa2
